## Introduction:

RISC-V ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) is an assembly language through which we communication with the system using binary notations.

## Course Description:

1. RISC-V ISA
2. RTL & Synthesis of RISC-V based CPU core-picorv32
3. Physical design implementation of picorv32

## Flow:

C Program -> comipiled into assembly language -> Machine Language -> Execution/Implementing in hardware

## System software consists of:

1) Operating system: consists of HLL(High Level Language) like C,C++
2) Compiler: it consists of instruction sets which compiles the HLL into Assembly language.
3) Assembler: it takes the help of HDLs(Hardware Description Language) to convert it to binary form. 

## Contents of this course:
1. Pseudo instructions
2. Base integer instructions RV64I
3. Multiply extension RV64M
4. Single & Double precision floating point extension RV64F & RV64D
5. Application Binary Interface(ABI)
6. Memory Allocation & Stack Pointer

## DAY1

Write a C program to calculate sum of numbers from 1 to n.

Compiling using C
